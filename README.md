# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a website project centered around food recipes structured and designed entirely from HTML.
Later, the website will be revisited and editing with CSS to give the website a more modern look.

2/5/22:
I am finished with building and designing the food recipe website. Here are some skills I implemented 
that furthered my understanding of HTML with the help of this project. 

First are the relative links and absolute links. Each recipe webpage has a relative link implemented for
displaying an image of the dish. Additionally, each recipe webpage has a absolute link implemented to 
connected viewers to the source of where the dish recipe came from.

Another meaningful HTML skill implemented in this website is properly structuring and designing each webpage
with the help of header elements as well as ordered and unordered list elements.

The point of this project is to allow the creater to feel a little more confortable with HTML basics and I think it was a success.
I'll be back and with a little more style. #CSS
